# ACP-Prediction
# ACP-ADA recorded an average accuracy of 86.48%, and Mathew's correlation coefficient of 74.01% for dataset ACP740 and 90.83% and 81.65% for datasets ACP240, consequently it can be a very useful tool in drug development and biomedical research. 
# Process.py is used to preprocess the peptide sequence for changing the variable length of peptide into fixed length
# AAINDEX.py to calculate the AAINDEX feature
# FeatureSelection.py for Selecting the AAINDEX optimal 50 feature
# AAC.py can be used to calculate Amino Acid Composition of peptides
# The trained model model.pkl can be used for evaluation of result
# Problem of overfitting can be accessed by running the code of Overfitting in DNN and CNN.py
# cd-hit0.35 is a trained model with newly constructed dataset with cut-off 0.35 and can be used to evalute the test datasets.
# Result from Data augmentation can be accessed running ACPBOOST.py
# Result from No data augmentation can be accessed running nodataaugmentation(2).py
# The prediction framework of the model can be accessed running Predicition.py
